# VBA-Challenge

This assignment used VBA to look at stock market data. In this assignment we had to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information. Get the ticker symbol, provide yearly change, get the percent change, and the total stock volume. We also had to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red. This was done for the years 2014-2016. In addition, we wanted to find the Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease and Greatest total volume for each year.

The excel file was too large to be able to upload it to git hub. However, I have provided screenshots samples of the data for the 3 years and provided my code that I used to run this challenge.
